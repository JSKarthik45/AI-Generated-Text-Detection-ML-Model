TRAIN_2,"As each new means of communication and social interaction is introduced, social customs and etiquette evolve in response. For example, it took time before the practice of saying â€œhelloâ€ and identifying oneself became the universal way to initiate a phone conversation. By the 1980s, a system of topical news postings , carried on the Internet was becoming widely used in universities, the computer industry, and scientific institutions. Many new users did not understand the system, and posted messages that were off topic. Others used their postings as to insult or attack (â€œflameâ€) other users, particularly in newsgroups discussing perennially controversial topics such as abortion. When a significant number of postings in a newsgroup are devoted to flaming and counter-flaming, many users who had sought civilized, intelligent discussion leave in protest. In 1984, Chuq von Rospach wrote a document entitled â€œA Primer on How to Work with the Usenet Community. â€ It and later guides to net etiquette or â€œnetiquetteâ€ offered useful guidelines to new users and to more experienced users who wanted to facilitate civil discourse.",Human-written
TRAIN_3,"These suggestions include:, Learn about the purpose of a newsgroup before you post to it. If a group is moderated, understand the moderatorâ€™s guidelines so your postings wonâ€™t be rejected. , Before posting, follow some discussions to see what sort of language, tone, and attitude seems to be appropriate for this group Do not post bulky graphics or other attachments unless the group is designed for them. , Avoid â€œad hominemâ€ (to the person) attacks when discussing disagreements. , Do not post in ALL CAPS, which is interpreted as â€œshouting. â€, Check your postings for proper spelling and grammar. On the other hand, avoid â€œflamingâ€ other users for their spelling or grammar errors. , When replying to an existing message, include enough of the original message to provide context for your reply, but no more. , If you know the answer to a question or problem raised by another user, send it to that user by e-mail. That way the newsgroup doesnâ€™t get cluttered up with dozens of versions of the same information.",Human-written
TRAIN_4,"In recent years there has been growing concern that Internet users may eventually be treated differently by service providers depending on the kind of data they download or the kind of application programs they use online. Advocates of network (or net) neutrality , want legislation that would bar cable, DSL, or other providers , from making such distinctions, such as by charging content providers higher fees for high volumes of data or even blocking certain applications. Advocates of net neutrality believe that, since there are rather limited choices for broadband Internet service, discrimination on the basis of Web content could lead to a loss of freedom for consumers and providers alike",Human-written
TRAIN_5,"By the late 1970s, researchers at many major universities were using the UNIX operating system ,. In 1979, a suite of utilities called UUCP was distributed with the widely used UNIX Version 7. These utilities could be used to transfer files between UNIX computers that were linked by some form of telephone or network connection. Two Duke University graduate students, Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis, decided to set up a way in which users on different computers could share a collection of files containing text messages on various topics. They wrote a simple set of shell scripts that could be used for distributing and viewing these message files. The first version of the news network linked computers at Duke and at the University of North Carolina. Soon these programs were revised and rewritten in the C language and distributed to other UNIX users as the â€œAâ€ release of the News software. During the 1980s, the news system was expanded and features such as moderated newsgroups were added. As the Internet and its TCP/IP protocol , became a more widespread standard for connecting computers, a version of News using the NNTP (Network News Transmission Protocol) over the Internet was released in 1986. Netnews is a mature system today, with news reading software available for virtually every type of computer",Human-written
TRAIN_6,"Netnews postings are simply text files that begin with a set of standard headers, similar to those used in e-mail. (Like e-mail, news postings can have binary graphics or program files attached, using a standard called MIME, for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions. )The files are stored on news serversâ€”machines that have the spare capacity to handle the hundreds of gigabytes of messages now posted each week. The files are stored in a typical hierarchical UNIX fashion, grouped into approximately 75,000 different newsgroups. As shown in the following table, the newsgroups are broken down into 10 major categories. The names of individual groups begin with the major category and then specify subdivisions. For example, the newsgroup comp. sys. ibm. pc deals with IBM PC-compatible personal computers, while comp. os. linux deals with the Linux operating system.",Human-written
TRAIN_7,"The servers are linked into a branching distribution system. Messages being posted by users are forwarded to the nearest major regional â€œnodeâ€ site, which in turn distributes them to other major nodes. In turn, when messages arrive at a major node from another region, they are distributed to all the smaller sites that share the newsfeed. Due to the volume of groups and messages, many sites now choose to receive only a subset of the total newsfeed. Sites also determine when messages will expire (and thus be removed from the site). There are dozens of different news reading programs that can be used to view the available newsgroups and postings. On UNIX systems, programs such as elm and tin are popular, while other newsreaders cater to Windows, Macintosh, and other systems. Major Web browsers such as Netscape and Internet Explorer offer simplified news reading features. To use these news readers, the user accesses a newsfeed at an address provided by the Internet Service Provider (ISP). There are also services that let users simply navigate through the news system by following the links on a Web page. The former service called DejaNews, now Google Groups, is the best-known and most complete such site",Human-written
TRAIN_8,"NLP is a multidisciplinary field that draws from linguistics and computer science, particularly artificial intelligence ,. In terms of linguistics, a program must be able to deal with words that have multiple meanings (â€œwind up the clockâ€ and â€œthe wind is cold todayâ€) as well as grammatical ambiguities (in the phrase â€œlittle girlâ€™s schoolâ€ is it the school that is little, the girls, or both?). Of course each language has its own forms of ambiguity. Programs can use several strategies for dealing with these problems, including using statistical models to predict the likely meaning of a given phrase based on a â€œcorpusâ€ of existing text in that language ,. As formidable as the task of extracting the correct (literal) meaning from text can be, it is really only the first level of natural language processing. If a program is to successfully summarize or draw conclusions about a news report from North Korea, for example, it would also have to have a knowledge base of facts about that country and/or a set of â€œframesâ€ , about how to interpret various situations such as threat, bluff, or compromise. )",Human-written
TRAIN_9,"The idea of networks has been around for centuries, as people have always sought ways to connect with each other over long distances. However, the modern computer network as we know it today began to take shape in the mid-20th century. In the 1950s, computers were large, expensive, and rare machines that were primarily used by governments, large corporations, and academic institutions. These computers were often housed in large rooms or buildings and were operated by trained technicians. One of the earliest computer networks was the SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) system, which was developed in the late 1950s by the United States Air Force. The SAGE system was designed to provide early warning of potential air attacks by the Soviet Union. It used a network of interconnected computers to track incoming enemy aircraft and coordinate defensive responses. In the 1960s, the US Department of Defense developed the ARPANET, which was the first wide-area network to use packet switching. The ARPANET was initially designed as a way for researchers at different universities and research institutions to share computing resources and collaborate on research projects. Over the years, computer networks evolved and became more sophisticated, eventually leading to the creation of the World Wide Web in the 1990s. Today, networks are an essential part of our daily lives, connecting people and devices all over the world and enabling us to access information and services instantly from almost anywhere.",AI-generated
TRAIN_10,"The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual model that describes the communication process between computing systems. It is composed of seven layers, each of which defines a specific function in the communication process. The layers are:Physical layer: This layer is responsible for transmitting raw data between devices using physical connections like cables, wires, or radio signals. It defines the electrical and physical specifications for the connection. Data link layer: This layer is responsible for transmitting data between devices on the same physical network. It defines how data is organized into frames for transmission and how errors are detected and corrected. Network layer: This layer is responsible for routing data between different networks. It determines the optimal path for data to travel and uses protocols like IP (Internet Protocol) to transmit data between networks. Transport layer: This layer provides reliable, end-to-end communication between devices. It breaks down data into smaller packets for transmission and ensures that they are received correctly at the other end. Session layer: This layer establishes, manages, and terminates connections between devices. It allows applications on different devices to establish a communication session and manage the exchange of data. Presentation layer: This layer is responsible for data representation and encryption. It transforms data into a format that can be understood by the application layer and encrypts it for secure transmission. Application layer: This layer provides services to end-users, such as email, file transfer, and web browsing. It defines the protocols and formats used by applications to communicate with each other. The OSI model is a reference model and does not specify any particular protocol or technology. However, it provides a common framework that helps network designers and developers to understand the various functions and interactions between different layers of the network.",AI-generated
TRAIN_11,"NAS stands for Network-Attached Storage. It refers to a storage device that is connected to a network and allows multiple users and devices to access and share files and data over that network. NAS devices typically have their own operating systems and can provide a wide range of features such as file sharing, backup and recovery, media streaming, and remote access. NAS devices can be used in both home and business settings to centralize and manage data storage across multiple devices and users. They are often used as a more cost-effective and flexible alternative to traditional file servers, which require dedicated hardware and IT support. NAS devices can range in size from small, single-drive units to large enterprise-level systems with multiple drives and advanced features.",AI-generated
TRAIN_12,"A Storage Area Network (SAN) is a dedicated high-speed network that provides block-level access to data storage. In a SAN, storage devices such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and other storage appliances are connected to servers through a series of switches and/or hubs. SANs are designed to provide high-speed, reliable access to large amounts of data, and are often used in enterprise environments where large amounts of data need to be stored and accessed by multiple servers and applications. SANs provide centralized storage management, which allows administrators to allocate storage resources to servers and applications as needed. SANs typically use Fibre Channel or iSCSI protocols to connect storage devices to the network. Fibre Channel is a high-speed, dedicated network technology that provides very low latency and high reliability. iSCSI, on the other hand, is an IP-based protocol that allows storage devices to be connected to the network using standard Ethernet connections. SANs can provide a number of benefits, including increased performance, scalability, and availability of data. They are often used in data centers and other large-scale IT environments to provide high-performance storage for critical applications and data.",AI-generated
TRAIN_13,"Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction that typically focuses on a future dystopian society dominated by advanced technology and corporate control. The term was first used in the 1980s to describe a type of science fiction that features a gritty, urban setting, high-tech weaponry, and a distinct anti-authoritarian attitude. The central themes of cyberpunk often include a focus on the dangers of technology and the impact of artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and cybernetic enhancements on human society. It often explores themes of social decay, economic inequality, and the struggle of individuals to find their place in a complex and oppressive world. Some well-known examples of cyberpunk include William Gibson's Neuromancer, Bruce Sterling's Schismatrix, and the movies Blade Runner and The Matrix. Cyberpunk has also influenced other media, such as video games, music, and fashion.",AI-generated
TRAIN_14,"Neuroprosthetics is a field of study that involves developing devices that can replace or restore the function of the nervous system. These devices are designed to interface directly with the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves and can be used to restore movement, sensation, or other functions that may have been lost due to injury or disease. At Duke University, researchers have been working on developing advanced neuroprosthetics that can help people with spinal cord injuries regain movement and mobility. One of the key areas of focus has been on developing brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) that can translate brain activity into movement. In a recent study published in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers at Duke University demonstrated that a monkey with a spinal cord injury was able to regain the ability to walk with the help of a brain-controlled robotic exoskeleton. The monkey had electrodes implanted in its brain that were able to decode signals related to movement and translate them into commands that controlled the robotic exoskeleton. The researchers also used a wireless connection to send feedback from the exoskeleton back to the monkey's brain, which allowed it to adjust its movements in real-time. This approach has the potential to enable people with spinal cord injuries to regain movement and independence. Overall, the research carried out at Duke University and other institutions in the field of neuroprosthetics is aimed at developing new and innovative approaches to restoring function and improving the quality of life for people with neurological disorders or injuries.",AI-generated
TRAIN_15,"Neurality refers to the concept of neural networks, which are a type of artificial intelligence modeled after the structure and function of the human brain. Neural networks are composed of interconnected nodes, called artificial neurons, that process and transmit information. Each neuron receives input from multiple other neurons and computes a weighted sum of these inputs. The neuron then passes this sum through a nonlinear activation function to produce an output, which is then transmitted to other neurons. This process of computing weighted sums and passing the results through activation functions is repeated multiple times, allowing the neural network to build increasingly complex representations of the input data. Neural networks can be trained to perform a wide range of tasks, such as image recognition, language translation, and even playing games like chess. The training process involves adjusting the weights on the connections between neurons so as to minimize a chosen loss function. This process is repeated for multiple passes over the training data, until the network has learned to accurately predict the desired output for a given input.",AI-generated
TRAIN_16,"NLP, or Natural Language Processing, is a field of study and technology concerned with the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. It involves using algorithms and statistical models to analyze and understand human language and to generate text or speech in response. For example, consider a simple NLP application: sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is the task of determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text, such as a movie review. A sentiment analysis model might take in a movie review written in English and output a label indicating whether the review is positive, negative, or neutral. The model might make this determination by analyzing the words used in the review and their relationships to each other, as well as other information such as the context in which the words are used.",AI-generated
TRAIN_17,"Multitasking refers to the ability of an individual or a system to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. In a computing context, multitasking refers to the ability of an operating system to run multiple programs or processes at the same time, allowing the user to switch between them or have multiple programs running in the background. For humans, multitasking can refer to the ability to perform multiple tasks or activities at the same time, such as typing an email while listening to music, or cooking dinner while talking on the phone. However, research has shown that human multitasking is often not as effective as performing each task separately and in sequence, as multitasking can lead to decreased productivity and increased stress. In both human and computer systems, multitasking can also refer to the ability to quickly switch between tasks and effectively allocate resources to different tasks as needed. This requires effective management of resources, such as memory and processing power, as well as efficient algorithms for scheduling and switching between tasks.",AI-generated

TRAIN_20,"With the exception of a few experimental systems, color graphics first became widely available only with the beginnings of desktop computers in the late 1970s. The first microcomputers were able to display only a few colors (some, indeed, displayed only monochrome or grayscale). Todayâ€™s PC video hardware has the potential to display millions of colors, though of course the human eye cannot directly distinguish colors that are too close together. There are several important schemes that are used to define a â€œcolor spaceâ€â€”that is, a range of values that can be associated with physical colors.",Human-written

TRAIN_24,"Compilers are traditionally thought of as having a â€œfront endâ€ that analyzes the source code (high-level language statements) and a â€œback endâ€ that generates the appropriate low-level code. The front end processing begins with lexical analysis. The compiler scans the source program looking for matches to valid tokens as defined by the language. A token is any word or symbol that has meaning in the language, such as a keyword (reserved word) such as if or while. Next, the tokens are parsed or grouped according to the rules of the language. The result of parsing is a â€œparse treeâ€ that resolves statements into their component parts. For example, an assignment statement may be parsed into an identifier, an assignment operator (such as =), and a value to be assigned. The value in turn may be an arithmetic expression that consists of operators and operands.",Human-written
TRAIN_25,"The process of code generation usually involves multiple passes that gradually substitute machine-specific code and data for the information in the parse tree. An important consideration in modern compilers is optimization, which is the process of substituting equivalent (but more efficient) constructs for the original output of the front end. For example, an optimizer can replace an arithmetic expression with its value so that it need not be repeatedly calculated while the program is running. It can also â€œhoist outâ€ an invariant expression from a loop so that it is calculated only once before the loop begins. On a larger scale, optimization can also improve the communication between different parts (procedures) of the program. The compiler must attempt to â€œproveâ€ that the change it is making in the program will never cause the program to operate incorrectly. It can do this, for example, by tracing the possible paths of execution through the program (such as through branching and loops) and verifying that each possible path yields the correct result. A compiler that is too â€œaggressiveâ€ in making assumptions can produce subtle program errors. (Many compilers allow the user to control the level of optimization, and whether to optimize for speed or for compactness of program size. ) During development, a compiler is often set to include special debugging code in the output. This code preserves potentially important information that can help the debugging facility better identify program bugs. After the program is working correctly, it will be recompiled without the debugging code",Human-written
TRAIN_26,"A compiler is a program that takes as input a program written in a source language and produces as output an equivalent program written in another (target) language. Usually the input program is in a high-level language such as C++ and the output is in assembly language for the target machine ,. Compilers are useful because programming directly in low-level machine instructions (as had to be done with the first computers) is tedious and prone to errors. Use of assembly language helps somewhat by allowing substitution of symbols (variable names) for memory locations and the use of mnemonic names for operations (such as â€œadd for addition, rather than some binary instruction code). An assembler is essentially a compiler that needs to make only relatively simple translations, because assembly language is still at a relatively low level.",Human-written
TRAIN_27,"Netnews, or Usenet, is a distributed system for exchanging news and information in the form of messages posted to newsgroups. The system is decentralized, meaning that there is no central server or authority that controls it. Instead, messages are distributed across a network of interconnected servers, which synchronize with each other to ensure that all messages are available to all users. Here's how the distribution and reading of netnews works:Posting a message: Users can post messages to a newsgroup by composing a message in their newsreader software and submitting it to their local news server. The message is then propagated to other servers that subscribe to the newsgroup, until it reaches all servers in the network. Replication and synchronization: Each news server stores a copy of all messages it receives, and periodically synchronizes with other servers to exchange new messages and updates. This ensures that all servers have the same set of messages, and that users can access the latest messages from any server in the network. Reading messages: Users can browse newsgroups and read messages using their newsreader software. The software retrieves messages from their local news server, and can also retrieve messages from other servers in the network if the local server does not have a copy of a particular message. Message threading: Netnews uses a threading system to group related messages together in a tree-like structure, based on their subject and message ID. This makes it easy for users to follow a conversation or track the evolution of a discussion over time. Archiving: Messages are typically archived on news servers, and can be accessed by users even after they have been removed from their local server or the server they were originally posted to. This allows users to search for and access older messages and discussions. Overall, the distribution and reading of netnews is based on a decentralized, peer-to-peer system that relies on the synchronization and replication of messages across a network of servers. This allows users to access a wide range of topics and discussions from anywhere in the network, while also ensuring that messages are distributed and stored redundantly to prevent loss or corruption.",AI-generated

Better Energy Efficiency: Many current brain implants require regular battery replacements, which can be invasive and inconvenient. In the future, it is likely that brain implants will become more energy-efficient, potentially using novel power sources like body heat or motion. Enhanced Sensing: Current brain implants can detect neural activity, but in the future, it is possible that they will be able to sense additional signals like blood flow, temperature, or chemical changes in the brain. This could provide more detailed information about brain function and enable more precise treatment. Integration with AI: As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies become more advanced, it is likely that brain implants will be able to integrate with these systems.

A program can easily â€œstep throughâ€ a list by starting with the first item, process-ing its data, then using the pointer to move to the next item, continuing until some condition is met or the end of the list is reached.",Human-written

Unlike an array, a list need use only as much memory as it needs to accommodate the current number of items (includ-ing their associated pointers).

TRAIN_39,"JavaScript is one of several popular languages that can enable Web pages to interact with users more quickly and efficiently ,. The language first appeared in the mid-1990sâ€™ Netscape 2 browser under the name LiveScript. Technically, JavaScript is the Sun microsystems trademark for its implementation of a standard called ECmAScript. Despite the name, Java-Script is not directly related to the Java programming lan-guage. In its early years JavaScript was perhaps a victim of its own success. Having a relatively easy-to-use scripting lan-guage provided an easier way to add features such as 3D buttons and pop-up windows to formerly humdrum Web forms. However, as with an earlier generationâ€™s fondness for multiple fonts, early JavaScript programmers were often prone to add unnecessary and confusing clutter to Web pages. Besides sometimes annoying users, early JavaScript also suffered from significant differences in how it was implemented by the major browsers. As a result, Netscape users were sometimes stymied by JavaScript written for micr osoft Internet Explorer, and vice versa. Finally, browser flaws have sometimes allowed JavaScript to be used to com-promise security such as by installing malware-infested â€œbrowser helpers. â€ As a result, many security experts began to recommend that users disable JavaScript execution in their browsers.",Human-written
TRAIN_40,"Java has largely fulfilled this promise for Web developers. C++ programmers have an easy learning curve to Java, since the two languages have very similar syntax and a similar use of classes and other object-oriented features. On the other hand, programmers who donâ€™t know C++ benefit from Java being more streamlined than C++. For example, Java avoids the necessity to use pointers , and uses classes as the consistent building block of program structure. Software powerhouses such as microsoft (until recently) and IBm have joined Sun in pro-moting Java. Another much-touted feature of Java is its platform independence. The language itself is separate from the vari-ous operating system platforms. For each platform, a Java Vir tual machine ( JVm) is created, which interprets or com-piles the code generated by the Java compiler so it can run on that platform. For security, Java applets run within a â€œsandboxâ€ or restricted environment so the user is protected from mali-cious Java programs.

TRAIN_42,"An interpreter is a program that analyzes (parses) program-ming commands or statements in a high-level language ,, creates equivalent executable instructions in machine code , and executes them. An interpreter differs from a compiler in that the lat-ter converts the entire program to an executable file rather than processing and executing it a statement at a time . many earlier versions of the BASIC programming lan-guage were implemented as interpreters. Since an inter-preter only has to hold one program statement at a time in memory, it could run on early microcomputers that had only a few tens of thousands of bytes of system memory. How-ever, interpreters run programs considerably more slowly than a compiled program would run. One reason is that an interpreter â€œthrows awayâ€ each source code statement after it interprets it. This means that if a statement runs repeat-edly ,, it must be re-interpreted each time it runs. A compiler, on the other hand, would create only one set of machine code instructions for the loop and then move on. Also, because a compiler keeps the entire program in memory, it can analyze the relationship between multiple statements and recognize ways to rearrange or substitute them for greater efficiency.",Human-written

The disk itself consists of a rigid aluminum alloy platter coated with a magnetic oxide material. The platter can be rotated at speeds of more than 10,000 rpm. A typical drive consists of a stack of such platters mounted on a rotating spindle, with a read/write head mounted above each platter. Early hard drive heads were controlled by a stepper motor, which positioned the head in response to a series of electrical pulses. (This system is still used for floppy drives. ) Todayâ€™s hard drives, however, are controlled by a voice-coil actuator, similar in structure to an audio speaker. The coil surrounds a magnet. When a current enters the coil, it gen-erates a magnetic field that interacts with that of the perma-nent magnet, moving the coil and thus the disk head. Unlike the stepper motor, the voice coil is continuously variable and its greater precision allows data tracks to be packed more tightly on the platter surface, increasing disk capacity. The storage capacity of a drive is determined by the number of platters and the spacing (and thus number) of tracks that can be laid down on each platter. Capacities have steadily increased while prices have plummeted: In 1980, for example, a hard drive for an Apple II microcom-put er cost more than $1,000 and held only 5 mB of data.

TRAIN_84,"Chess has a long history of being used as a benchmark for measuring the capabilities of computers, specifically in the area of artificial intelligence (AI). Chess is a complex game that requires strategy, foresight, and decision-making, making it a challenging task for computers to master. The first notable example of computer chess was the 1950s when computer scientists began experimenting with programming computers to play chess. However, it wasn't until the 1970s when the first computer chess tournament was held, and the first commercially available computer chess program, Chess 4. 0, was released. Since then, computer chess has made significant progress, and today, the best computer chess programs can easily defeat even the most skilled human players. This progress has been driven by advances in hardware and software, as well as improvements in AI techniques such as search algorithms, game tree pruning, and machine learning. In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue computer famously defeated chess world champion Garry Kasparov in a highly publicized match. This event marked a significant milestone in computer chess and demonstrated that computers could outperform human players in certain areas.",AI-generated
TRAIN_85,"Chess has been an important testbed for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) since the earliest days of computing. The game's complexity and strategic depth make it an ideal domain for exploring the limits of machine intelligence and testing new AI algorithms. One of the key challenges in developing AI systems for chess is the enormous search space of possible moves. In the game of chess, there are approximately 10^120 possible games, which is many orders of magnitude larger than the number of atoms in the observable universe. To overcome this challenge, AI researchers have developed a range of techniques, such as alpha-beta pruning, minimax search, and Monte Carlo tree search, to efficiently explore the search space and find good moves. Another challenge in developing AI for chess is representing the game state in a way that is amenable to machine learning. Historically, this has been done using hand-crafted features that encode various aspects of the game state, such as the relative values of the pieces and the mobility of the pieces. However, in recent years, deep learning techniques have been used to automatically learn representations of the game state from raw board positions.",AI-generated

TRAIN_87,"In computing, the term ""last mile"" refers to the final leg of the telecommunications network that connects the end user to the wider network. The last mile typically refers to the physical connection between a user's premises (such as a home or office) and the telecommunications provider's network infrastructure. The last mile is often considered the most challenging and expensive part of the telecommunications network to build and maintain, as it involves deploying physical infrastructure (such as cables or wireless towers) to reach individual homes and businesses. In many cases, the cost of deploying and maintaining this infrastructure can be prohibitively high, particularly in rural or remote areas. The quality and reliability of the last mile connection can have a significant impact on the performance and usability of internet and telecommunications services. For example, if the last mile connection is slow or unreliable, users may experience slow internet speeds, dropped calls, or other issues that impact their ability to access and use digital services.

TRAIN_88,"In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a set of properties (also known as attributes or fields) and methods that are common to all objects of a certain type. A class provides a way to encapsulate data and functionality, allowing for modular and organized programming. It defines the behavior and properties of a certain type of object, but does not create any actual objects itself. Instead, an object is created from a class using a process called instantiation. A class can be thought of as a template or a cookie cutter, while an object is an instance of that template or cookie cutter. For example, a class called ""Person"" might define attributes such as name, age, and address, and methods such as ""walk"" and ""speak"". An object created from the Person class would have specific values for those attributes (such as ""John"", 30, and ""123 Main St. ""), and would be able to perform the methods defined in the class. Classes can also inherit properties and methods from other classes, allowing for more complex relationships and structures. This is known as inheritance and is a key feature of OOP.",AI-generated

Syntax Analysis: The compiler analyzes the structure of the code to ensure that it conforms to the syntax rules of the programming language. This stage involves creating an abstract syntax tree (AST) that represents the structure of the code. Semantic Analysis: The compiler performs checks to ensure that the code is semantically correct, such as checking that variables are declared before they are used, and that functions are called with the correct number and type of arguments. Code Generation: The compiler generates machine code that can be executed by the computer. This involves translating the AST into a lower-level representation of the code, such as assembly language or machine code. Optimization: The compiler may perform various optimizations on the generated code to improve its performance or reduce its size. This may involve removing redundant code, reordering instructions, or replacing code with more efficient alternatives.

It is a performance-based marketing strategy that involves four main parties: the advertiser, the affiliate, the customer, and the network. In affiliate marketing, the advertiser provides the affiliate with promotional materials, such as banner ads or product links, to use in their marketing efforts. The affiliate then promotes the advertiser's products or services to their audience, such as on their website or social media channels. When a customer clicks on the affiliate's promotional link and makes a purchase, the affiliate earns a commission from the advertiser. Affiliate marketing can be beneficial for all parties involved. Advertisers can reach new customers and increase their sales without having to invest in traditional advertising methods. Affiliates can earn money by promoting products or services that align with their brand and audience. Customers can discover new products or services that they may not have found otherwise. Affiliate marketing can be used in a variety of industries, including e-commerce, travel, finance, and more.

The most common way to access web services is through HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), using a variety of HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. To access a web service, you typically need to know its API (Application Programming Interface), which is a set of rules that defines how clients can interact with the service. The API typically includes information about the URL structure, available HTTP methods, input and output formats, and any authentication or authorization requirements. Here are a few common ways to access web services:Using a web browser: Some web services provide a web interface that you can access using a web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. This allows you to interact with the service using a graphical user interface (GUI) rather than writing code. Using a programming language: Many programming languages provide libraries or frameworks for accessing web services, such as Python's requests library or Java's Spring framework. These libraries typically abstract away the details of HTTP communication, allowing you to focus on writing code to interact with the service. Using a tool like Postman: Postman is a popular tool for testing and interacting with web services. It allows you to send HTTP requests to a web service, inspect the responses, and save the requests for later use. Using command-line tools: Tools like curl or wget can be used to send HTTP requests from the command line. These tools are often used in scripts or automation workflows. Overall, accessing web services requires an understanding of the service's API and the tools and libraries available in your programming language or environment.

They then use statistical methods to determine the bits of key by observing many operations using the same key. Timing attacks typically require a significant number of chosen ciphertexts. Related attacks can use any measure of differences in the performance of the encryption and decryption functions such as power consumption and heat dissipation. Timing attacks and related attacks can be protected against to some degree by â€œblindingâ€ the devices performing encryption and decryption computations so that all computations have the same performance, regardless of the particular key and message being used. However, this can have a substantial performance cost, as it requires all computations to have worst-case performance. Such attacks can also be protected against by designing systems so that they will not act as an â€œoracleâ€ by decrypting and returning all and any messages that come their way, thereby preventing an attacker from obtaining the necessary data to carry out the attack. However, this is not always possible without interfering with the purpose of the system.",Human-written

The first scanners were developed in the 1950s and 1960s for specialized applications such as document archiving and scientific research. In the 1980s, scanners became more widely available as personal computers became more popular. The earliest scanners were flatbed scanners that used a moving light source and a photosensitive element to scan documents or images. Over time, scanners became more sophisticated, with faster scanning speeds, higher resolutions, and more advanced features such as automatic document feeders, optical character recognition (OCR), and duplex scanning. Today, scanners are used in a variety of applications, from document archiving and digitization to graphic design, medical imaging, and security screening. There are many different types of scanners available, including flatbed scanners, sheet-fed scanners, handheld scanners, and drum scanners, each with their own strengths and limitations.

However, there are privacy and security concerns that remain to be fully resolved. The primary threat is that unauthorized persons could illicitly obtain information or track people or goods, for purposes ranging from simple larceny to identity theft. Privacy rights organizations have also raised concerns that information about consumer purchases could be used for unwanted marketing (or sold to third parties), while information about a library patronâ€™s reading habits could trigger unwarranted government investigations in the name of fighting terrorism. There is an incentive to produce RFID cards and tags that are resistant to unauthorized reading or tampering. A cryptographic protocol can be used such that no information will be sent or received unless the reader and tag â€œknowâ€ the correct keys. Another possibility is to create a device that can â€œjamâ€ reading attempts in the deviceâ€™s vicinity, perhaps protecting a customerâ€™s grocery cart from being scanned. Finally, RFID cards can be put inside in a sleeve of material that blocks the signals. However, cryptographic and other security technologies raise the cost of RFID devices and may make them impracticable for some applications. In September 2006 the National Science Foundation awarded a $1. 1 million grant to the RFID Consortium for Security and Privacy to study potential risks and safeguards for the technology.

The â€œfloatingâ€ means thatthe location of the decimal point can be moved as necessaryto fit the number within the specified digit range. A floatingpoint number is actually stored in four separate parts. Firstcomes the sign, indicating whether the number is negativeor positive. Next comes the mantissa, which contains theactual digits of the number, both before and after the decimal point. The radix is the â€œbaseâ€ for the number systemused. Finally, the exponent determines where the decimalpoint will be placed. For example, the base 10 number 247. 35 could be represented as 24735 Ã— 10-2. The -2 moves the decimal pointat the end two places to the left. However, floating-pointnumbers are normalized to a form in which there is just onedigit to the left of the decimal point.

TRAIN_208,"A hard drive is a non-volatile storage device used to store digital data, such as computer files and software applications. It consists of one or more platters, which are circular disks coated with a magnetic material that can store data, and a set of read/write heads that can read and write data to the platters. When data is written to a hard drive, the read/write heads magnetically encode the data onto the platters. To read the data, the read/write heads move over the platters and sense the magnetic fields to retrieve the encoded data. Hard drives typically spin at high speeds, often between 5400 and 7200 revolutions per minute (RPM), to enable faster data access. Hard drives come in different form factors, such as 2. 5-inch and 3. 5-inch drives, and in different capacities, ranging from a few hundred gigabytes to several terabytes. They can be connected to a computer via various interfaces, such as SATA, SCSI, or IDE, and can be internal or external. In addition to traditional hard drives, there are also solid-state drives (SSDs) that use flash memory to store data. Unlike hard drives, SSDs have no moving parts, which makes them faster and more durable than hard drives. However, they are generally more expensive and have lower storage capacities than hard drives.

The problem is this: When an applications program such as a word processor needs to print a document, how should the necessary commands be provided to the printer? If every application program has to include the appropriate set of commands for each device that might be in use, programs will be bloated and much development effort will be required for supporting devices rather than extending the functionality of the product itself. Instead, the manufacturers of printers and other devices such as scanners and graphics tablets typically provide a program called a driver.

Thus if there are 16 bits available, the maximum value for an integer is 65535. If negativenumbers are to be handled, a signed integer must be used(in most languages such as C, C++, and Java, an integer issigned unless unsigned is specified).

For example, when a Web address (URL) is typed into a browser, a DNS query is made to learn an IP address of a Web server associated with that name. Using the www. example. com URL, example. com is the domain name, and www is the hostname. DNS resolution maps www. example. com into an IP address (such as 192. 0. 2. 1). When a user needs to load a webpage, a conversion must occur between what a user types into their web browser (www. example. com) into an IP address required to locate the www. example. com site. The DNS system is an open worldwide network of database name servers that include 13 authoritative name servers that serve the DNS root zone level, known as ""root servers"". A root server (also called a DNS root nameserver) receives a DNS query that includes a domain name (e. g. www. thousandeyes. com), and responds by directing that request to a top-level domain (TLD) nameserver, based on the TLD of that domain such as . com, . net, and . org.

Probability is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 represents an impossible event and 1 represents a certain event. The probability of an event occurring can be calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. For example, if a coin is flipped, the probability of getting heads is 1/2 or 0. 5, since there are two possible outcomes (heads or tails) and one of them is favorable.

TRAIN_280,"Error correction is the process of detecting and correcting errors that occur during the transmission or storage of data. In computing, errors can occur due to a variety of factors such as data corruption, interference, or noise in the communication channel, or hardware malfunctions. Error correction codes are used to detect and correct errors in data. These codes are added to the data before transmission or storage, and they are designed to allow the receiver to detect and correct any errors that may occur during the process. One common error correction code is the Hamming code, which is a binary code that adds extra bits to the data being transmitted. These extra bits are calculated based on the original data and are used to detect and correct errors in the transmitted data. Another commonly used error correction code is the Reed-Solomon code, which is used to correct errors in block codes, such as those used in CDs and DVDs. Error correction is important in computing because it ensures the accuracy and reliability of data transmission and storage. Without error correction, data could be lost or corrupted during transmission, resulting in errors or incorrect information being received. Error correction helps to ensure that data is transmitted and stored accurately, which is critical for many applications, such as data transfer, online transactions, and digital communication.",AI-generated

A variety of routing algorithms can be used to determine the most efficient route given current traffic or line conditions. The transport layer views the packets as part of a complete transmission of an object (such as a Web page) and ensures that all the packets belonging to that object are sorted into their original sequence at the destination. This is necessary because packets belonging to the same message may be sent via different routes in keeping with traffic or line conditions. The session layer provides application programs communicating over the network with the ability to initiate, terminate, or restart an interrupted data transfer.

The arrayis the most basic structured data type; it represents a series of memory locations that hold data of one of the basic types. Thus, in Pascal an array of integer holds integers, each taking up two bytes of memory. Many languages have composite data types that can hold data of several different basic types. For example, the struct in C or the record in Pascal can hold data such as a personâ€™s first and last name, three lines of address (all arrays of characters, or strings), an employee number (perhaps an integer or double), a Boolean field representing the presence or absence of some status, and so on. This kind of data type is also called a user-defined data type because programmers can define and use these types in almost the same ways as they use the languageâ€™s built-in basic types. What is the difference between data types and data structures? There is no hard-and-fast distinction. Generally, data structures such as lists, stacks, queues, and trees are more complex than simple data types, because they include data relationships and special functions (such as pushing or popping data on a stack).

PHP can also be linked to user-interface libraries (such as GTK+ for Linux/UNIX) to create applications that run on the client machine rather than the server. PHP has a basic set of data types plus one called â€œresourceâ€ that represents data processed by special functions that return images, text files, database records, and so on. Additionally, PHP5 provides full support for objects, including private and protected member variables, constructors and destructors, and other features similar to those found in C++ and other languages. There are numerous libraries of open-source objects and functions that enable PHP scripts to perform common Internet tasks, including accessing database servers (such as MySQL) as well as extensions to the language to handle popular Web formats such as Adobe Flash animation. Programmers have access to a wide range of PHP resources through PEAR (the PHP Extension and Application Repository).

This is true, for example, in the analysis of events taking place in nuclear reactors. Fortunately computers can apply the laws of the system to each of many particles and determine the resulting actions from their aggregate behavior ,. Simulation is particularly important in fields where actual experiments are not possible because of distance or time. Thus, a hypothesis about the formation of the universe can be tested by applying it to a set of initial conditions believed to reflect those at or near the time of the big bang. However, even the most skilled scientists have trouble relating numbers to the shape and interaction of real-world objects. Computers have greatly aided in making it possible to visualize structures and phenomena using high-resolution 3D color graphics ,. Features of interest can be enhanced, and arbitrary (â€œfalseâ€) colors can be used to visually show such things as temperature or blood flow. These techniques can also be used to create interactive models where scientists can, for example, combine molecules in new ways and have the computer calculate the likely properties of the result. Finally, computer visualization and modeling can be used both to teach science and to give the general public some visceral grasp of the meaning of scientific theories and discoveries",Human-written

However, with the increasing use of e-commerce, security and privacy issues have become a concern for consumers. Here are some of the common security and privacy issues in e-commerce:Cybersecurity: Online transactions involve the exchange of sensitive information such as credit card details, personal information, and passwords. Therefore, e-commerce sites need to have strong cybersecurity measures to prevent data breaches, hacking, and other cyber threats. Payment fraud: Payment fraud is a common issue in e-commerce, where fraudsters use stolen credit card information to make fraudulent purchases. Online retailers need to have measures in place to detect and prevent payment fraud, such as fraud detection algorithms and multi-factor authentication. Privacy: Consumers are often hesitant to share their personal information online, as they fear it may be used for malicious purposes. Therefore, e-commerce sites need to have clear privacy policies and ensure that consumers' personal information is secure and not shared with third parties without their consent. Phishing scams: Phishing scams are a common issue in e-commerce, where fraudsters send emails or messages that appear to be from legitimate retailers, asking for personal information or login credentials. Online retailers need to educate their customers on how to spot and avoid phishing scams. Malware: Malware, such as viruses and Trojans, can infect e-commerce sites and compromise customers' personal information.

Invented in 1971, the first form of touchscreens to become part of daily life were found on automatic teller machines (ATMs) and point-of-sale credit card processors. Touchscreens can detect the pressure of a finger or stylus in several ways: A â€œresistiveâ€ touchscreen uses two layers of electrically conductive metallic material separated by a space. When an area is touched, the two layers are electrically connected, and the change in electrical current is registered and converted to a code that identifies the location touched. Surface acoustic wave (SAW) touchscreens use an ultrasonic wave that is interrupted by a touch; capacitive touchscreens respond to the change in electron storage (capacitance) caused by contact with a human body.

It was created by David Heinemeier Hansson in 2004 and has since become one of the most popular web frameworks for building dynamic, database-driven web applications. Rails provides a set of conventions and tools for building web applications, including support for database migrations, model-view-controller (MVC) architecture, and a wide range of plugins and gems that extend its functionality. One of the key features of Rails is its emphasis on convention over configuration. This means that Rails provides sensible defaults and conventions that help developers get up and running quickly without having to spend a lot of time configuring the framework. For example, Rails provides a default directory structure for organizing files, a default database schema for storing data, and a set of naming conventions that make it easy to map between database tables and Ruby classes. Rails is also known for its focus on developer productivity, with a philosophy that emphasizes simplicity, elegance, and developer happiness. This has made it a popular choice for startups and small businesses, as well as larger enterprises.

The first step is to define the userâ€™s requirements and to prepare precise specifications for the program. In doing so, the systems analyst is aided by methodologies developed by computer scientists over the last several decades ,. Often flowcharts or other aids are used to help visualize the operation of the program ,. After communicating with the user, the systems analyst must then communicate with the programmers, helping them understand what is needed and reviewing their work as they begin to design the program. Although the systems analyst may do little actual programming, he or she must be familiar with programming tools and practices. This may make it possible to suggest existing software or components that could be adapted instead of undertaking the cost and time involved with creating a new program. As a program is developed, systems analysts are often responsible for designing tests to ensure that the software works properly ,",Human-written
TRAIN_390,"Passive RFID tags have no power supply; the power induced by the reading signal is used to transmit the response. Because this power is very small, passive tags can only be read at distances from about 4 inches (10 cm) to a few yards (meters), depending on the antenna size and type. The main advantage of passive tags is that the lack of a battery makes them small, lightweight, and inexpensive, making them ideal for attaching to merchandise (they have also been embedded under the skin of pets and, in a few cases, even people). Smart cards for use in transit systems and similar applications are also passive; the system is activated by â€œtaggingâ€ or bringing the card near the reader. Active RFID tags have their own battery. Their advantage is that they are able to initiate communication with the reader, and the signal they send is much stronger, more reliable, and with greater range (up to about 1,500 feet [500 m]). The stronger signal allows for communication in rougher environments (such as outdoors for tracking cattle or shipping containers).",Human-written

Earlier, many PCs were not net-worked but could be connected via a dial-up modem. To established the connection, a terminal program running on one PC had to negotiate with its counterpart on the other machine, agreeing on whether data would be sent in 7- or 8-bit chunks, and the number of parity bits that would be included for error-checking ,. The sending program would inform the receiving program as to the name and basic type of the file. For binary files (files intended to be interpreted as literal binary codes, as with executable programs, images, and so on) the contents would be sent unchanged.

For example, thousands of â€œfiltersâ€ (algorithms for transforming images) have been written for Adobe Photoshop. These small programs are called plug-ins because they are designed to connect to the main program and provide their service whenever it is desired or required. Perhaps the most commonly encountered plug-ins are those available for Web browsers such as Firefox, Netscape, or Internet Explorer. Plug-ins can enable the browser to display new types of files (such as multimedia). Many standard programs for particular kinds of files are now provided both as stand-alone applications and as browser plug-ins. Examples include Adobe (PDF document format), Apple QuickTime (graphics, video, and animation), RealPlayer (streaming video and audio), and Macromedia Flash (interactive animation and presentation). These and many other plug-ins are offered free for the downloading, in order to increase the number of potential users for the formats and thus the market for the development packages. One of the most useful plug-ins found in most browsers is one that allows the browser to run Java applets ,. In turn, Java is often used to write other plug-ins. Beyond such traditional workhorses, a number of innovative browser plug-ins have appeared, particularly for the increasingly popular Firefox browser.

In the mid-1970s, when Xerox researchers were developing the laser printer, they realized they needed an actual programming language that could describe fonts, graphics, and other elements that could be printed on the more versatile new printers. PARC researchers developed InterPress; meanwhile two of them, John Warnock and Chuck Geschke, founded their own company in 1982 ,. They then created a more streamlined version of InterPress that they called PostScript. The first printer to include built-in PostScript capability was Appleâ€™s LaserWriter, in 1985. PostScript soon became the standard for a burgeoning industry ,. Because PostScript is an actual programming language (for a somewhat similar language, see Forth), software such as word processors can include functions that turn a text document into a PostScript document, ready for printing. A PostScript interpreter in the printer (or even in another application) interprets the PostScript commands to re-create the document. The commands specify rasters (combinations of straight lines and curves), which can be scaled and transformed to provide the specified output, including fonts, which can be enhanced by including â€œhintsâ€ to help the system identify key features.

The architecture of UNIX can be divided into several layers, each providing different services to the user and to the system. Kernel: The kernel is the core of the operating system, responsible for managing system resources such as memory, CPU time, and input/output devices. It also provides an interface between applications and the hardware. Shell: The shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system. It interprets user commands and passes them to the kernel for execution. There are several types of shells available in UNIX, including the Bourne shell (sh), C shell (csh), Korn shell (ksh), and Bash shell (bash). File system: The file system is responsible for managing files and directories on the storage devices. UNIX file systems are organized as a hierarchical tree structure, with the root directory (/) at the top and subdirectories branching out from there. Utilities: UNIX provides a set of command-line utilities for managing the operating system and performing various tasks, such as copying files, searching for text in files, and manipulating text files. These utilities include ls, cp, grep, and sed, among many others. Libraries: UNIX provides a set of standard libraries that can be used by application developers to simplify their coding efforts. These libraries include the Standard C Library (libc) and the POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) library.

These early systems were limited in their accuracy and were mostly used in specialized applications such as check processing. The introduction of personal digital assistants (PDAs) in the 1990s and the increasing use of tablet computers and smartphones in the 2000s led to renewed interest in handwriting recognition technology. By the early 2000s, handwriting recognition software had become widely available on mobile devices, allowing users to input text using a stylus or their finger.",AI-generated

These technologies include:Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS): Smart cars are equipped with a variety of sensors and cameras that enable ADAS features such as lane departure warning, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and blind spot monitoring. These features use computer algorithms to analyze data from the sensors and provide alerts or take action to prevent accidents. Connectivity: Smart cars are connected to the internet and other vehicles, enabling them to share data about traffic conditions, road hazards, and weather conditions. This connectivity also allows for over-the-air software updates, remote diagnostics, and other services. Infotainment: Smart cars offer advanced infotainment systems that provide features such as internet connectivity, voice commands, music streaming, and navigation. These systems are often integrated with the vehicle's ADAS features to provide real-time information and alerts. Self-driving: Some smart cars are capable of autonomous driving, using a combination of sensors, cameras, and computer algorithms to navigate roads without human intervention.

A good spam filter is the first line of defense and can block many phishing messages from getting to the user in the first place. Anti-phishing features are also increasingly included in Web browsers, or available as plug-ins. Thus â€œblacklistsâ€ of known phishing sites can be checked in real time and warnings given, or the siteâ€™s address can be blocked from access by the system. Web sites can also introduce an added layer of security: Bank of America, for example, asks users to select and label one of several images offered by the bank.

TRAIN_433,"IBM did succeed in creating RPG (Report Program Generator), a language designed to make it easier for programmers (including beginners) to generate business reports. Most COBOL programs read data, perform tests and calculations, and print the results. RPG, first released in 1964 for use with the new System/360 mainframe and the smaller System/3, simplifies this process and eliminates most writing of program code statements. A â€œclassicâ€ RPG program is built around the â€œRPGcycle,â€ consisting of three stages. During the input stage, the input device(s), file type, access specifications, and data record structure are specified. (These specifications can be quite elaborate. ) The heart of the program specifies calculations to be performed with the various data fields, while the output section specifies how the results will be laid out in report form, including such things as headers, footers, and sections. Subsequent versions of RPG added more features. RPGIV, released in 1994, includes the ability to define subroutines, for example. IBM has also released VisualAge RPG, which allows for the creation and running of RPG programs in the Microsoft Windows environment. There are also tools for interfacing RPG programs with various database systems and to use RPG for writing Web-based (CGI) programs",Human-written
TRAIN_434,"BASIC was invented at Dartmouth College in 1963â€“1964 by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz, both professors of mathematics, assisted by a group of undergraduate student programmers. Computers then were huge, slow, and expensive; there were no personal computers. Their goal was to bring easy and accessible computing to all students, not just science or engineering students. The method they chose called for developing a time-shared operating system, which would allow many users simultaneously. (This operating system was developed entirely by Dartmouth undergraduate students. ) The new language, BASIC, easy to learn and easy to use, was an essential part of this effort. BASIC was thus developed originally for a large multipleuser, time-shared system and not for personal computers, which did not appear widely until the early 1980s. It has been asked whyBASICwas invented. Couldnâ€™t an existing language have been used for the purpose? The answer to the second question is no, which also answers the first question. Other computer languages did exist in 1963, although there were not nearly as many as there are today. The principal ones were FORTRAN and Algol; most of the others are long since forgotten. Some of the common languages used todayâ€”C, C++, and Javaâ€”had not even been conceived. FORTRAN and Algol were each considered briefly. These languages were designed for production use on big machines or for scientific research, using punched cards. But neither was suitable for use by beginners, neither was particularly well suited for a time-shared environment, and neither permitted speedy handling of short programs. Kemeny and Kurtz had experimented with other simple computer languages as early as 1956, but with only modest success. So, in 1963, when they began building a time-shared system for students, they quickly realized that a new language had to be inventedâ€”BASIC.",Human-written

TRAIN_437,"A simulation is a simplified (but adequate) model that represents how a system works. The system can be an existing, real-world one, such as a stock market or a human heart, or a proposed design for a system, such as a new factory or even a space colony. If a system is simple enough (a cannonball falling from a height, for example), it is possible to use formulas such as those provided by Newton to get an exact answer. However, many real-world systems involve many discrete entities with complex interactions that cannot be captured with a single equation. During the 1940s, scientists encountered just this problem in attempting to understand what would happen under various conditions in a nuclear reaction. Together with physicist Enrico Fermi, two mathematicians, John von Neumann , and Stanislaw Ulam, devised a new way to simulate complex systems. Instead of trying fruitlessly to come up with some huge formula to â€œsolveâ€ the whole system, they applied probability formulas to each of a number of particlesâ€”in effect, â€œrolling the diceâ€ for each one and then observing their resulting distribution and behavior. Because of its analogy to gambling, this became known as the Monte Carlo method. It turned out to be widely useful not only for simulating nuclear reactions and particle physics but for many other activities (such as bombing raids or the spread of disease) where many separate things behave according to probabilities.",Human-written
TRAIN_438,"The large computers that first became available in the 1950s , used â€œline printers. â€ These devices have one hammer for each column of the output. A rapidly moving band of type moves under the hammers. Each hammer strikes the band when the correct character passes by. Printing is therefore done line by line, hence the name. Line printers were fast (600 lines per minute or more) but like the mainframes they served, they were bulky and expensive. The typewriter offered another point of departure for designing printers. A few early computers such as the BINAC (an offshoot of ENIAC) used typewriters rigged with magnetically controlled switches (solenoids). However, a more natural fit was with the Teletype, invented early in the 20th century to print telegraph messages. Since the Teletype is already designed to print from electrically transmitted character codes, it was easy to rig up a circuit to translate the contents of computer data into appropriate codes for printing. (Since the Teletype could send as well as receive messages, it was often used as a control terminal for computer operators or for time-sharing computer users into the 1970s. )The daisy-wheel printer was another typewriter-like device. It used a movable wheel with the letters embedded in slim â€œpetalsâ€ (hence the name).

TRAIN_445,"The bubble sort and quicksort are designed to work with records that are in random order. However, in many applications a database grows slowly over time. At any given time the existing database is already sorted, so it hardly makes sense to have to resort the whole database each time a new record is added. Instead, an insertion sort can be used. In its simplest form, the algorithm looks sequentially through the sorted records until it finds the first record whose key is higher than that of the new record. The new record can then be inserted just before that record, much like the way a bridge player might organize the cards in a hand. (Since inserting a record and physically moving all the higher records up in memory can be time-consuming, a linked list of key values and associated record number is often used instead. (See list processing. ) That way only the links need to be changed rather than any records being moved. The insertion sort was improved by Donald L. Shell in 1959. His â€œshellsortâ€ takes a recursive approach (like that in the quicksort), and applies the insertion sort procedure to successively smaller partitions. Another improvement on the insertion sort is the mergesort. As the name implies, this approach begins by creating two small lists of sorted records (using a simple comparison algorithm), then merging the lists into longer lists. Merging is accomplished by looking at the two keys on the top of two lists and taking whichever is lowest until the lists are exhausted. The merge sort also lends itself to a recursive approach, and it is comparable in speed and stability to the heapsort",Human-written

They have become an essential part of our daily lives, as they make it easy to find information on almost any topic. Here is a brief background on the development of search engines and the approaches to exploring the web:Directory-based search engines: In the early days of the web, search engines were based on directories of websites. These directories were organized by topic, and users could browse through them to find sites related to their interests. Examples of early directory-based search engines include Yahoo! and DMOZ. Keyword-based search engines: As the number of websites on the web grew, it became impractical to rely on manual directory listings. In the mid-1990s, keyword-based search engines were developed, which allowed users to search for specific words or phrases on the web. Examples of early keyword-based search engines include AltaVista and Lycos. PageRank algorithm: In the late 1990s, Google introduced a new algorithm called PageRank, which revolutionized the way search engines ranked web pages. PageRank is based on the idea that a web page is important if other important pages link to it. This allowed Google to provide more relevant and accurate search results than its competitors. Natural language processing: In recent years, search engines have started to incorporate natural language processing techniques to better understand the intent behind user queries. This has led to the development of more sophisticated search algorithms that can provide more personalized and accurate results. Approaches to exploring the web include:Browsing: This approach involves manually navigating through websites and following links to find information. Browsing is useful for discovering new websites and exploring topics in depth. Keyword search: This approach involves entering one or more keywords into a search engine and viewing the search results. Keyword search is useful for finding specific information quickly.

Early optical fiber could not be used for practical com-munication because of progressive attenuation (weakening) of the light as it traveled. However, by the 1970s the attenu-ation was being reduced to acceptable levels by removing impurities from the fibers. Today the light signals can travel hundreds of miles without the need for repeaters or amplifi-ers. In the 1990s a new type of optical fiber (photonic crys-tal) using diffraction became available.
